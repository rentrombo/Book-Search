With this application I wanted to make sure to execute the objective with as clean of a front-end as possible. I also wanted to work in packages to gain experience. I utilized minimal color to show errors and titles to be able to guide the user through the application more seamlessly. I created an empty list for reading list books to fill and attached my json. Being able to use packages in application development is vital so I wanted to include that aspect within this project.

**I had so much fun working on this. It was a challenge for me and the first time using a lot of different mechanics and languages. I have never created a Javascript program for non-web and have not used packages before. I struggled to get this to run correctly in my CLI but it could be because of my package file paths. I am still troubleshooting it to see exactly what I can fix.
I have never used Babel, color or API in this capacity so it has been a lot of learning new skills using resources from Google Books API, github examples like theo333, google-api, and Github docs. Not to mention registry/npm.com and the plethora of resources sourced on those pages. I definitely went in a few directions, realized they were not going to get me to my objective, and had to redirect. Figuring out what didn't work(key API and authentification) was just as valuable as seeing what did(get(params-maxResults). Setting up workflow configuration has a lot of moving parts but I linked them together as best I could here.
I chose this language specifically for the opportunity to learn something new. In any language, I am most versed in writing web applications so I thought I might as well learn as much as possible from this assesment experience.
I am eager to hear feedback and understand where I can improve.
Thank you!
