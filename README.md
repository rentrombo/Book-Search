# Book-Search
Search for a book and add it to a local reading list!

This application will give you the option of Searching a Book or going to your Reading List.
Use the arrow keys to navigate.
Press Enter to select.
Once a search has been conducted you have the option to add this to your Reading List. The program will let you know if the book has already been placed in this reading list.
You then can make your decision from the main menu again.
Enjoy!




**This was a challenge for me and the first time using a lot of different mechanics and languages. I have never created a Javascript program for outside of the web and have not used packages before. I struggled to get this to run correctly in my CLI but it could be because of my package file paths. I am still troubleshooting it to see exactly what I can fix.
I have never used Babel, color or API in this capacity so it has been a lot of learning new skills using resources from Google Books API, github examples like theo333, google-api, and Github docs. Not to mention registry/npm.com and the plethora of resources sourced on those pages. Setting up workflow configuration has a lot of moving parts but I linked them together as best I could here.
I chose this language specifically for the opportunity to learn something new. In any language, I am most versed in writing web applications so I thought I might as well learn as much as possible from this assesment experience.
I am eager to hear feedback and understand where I can improve.
Thank you!
