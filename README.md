### Dev Notes:

I had so much fun working on this. It was a challenge for me and the first time using a lot of different mechanics in this application. I have never created a Javascript program for non-web and have not used packages before. 
I have never used Babel, color or API in this capacity so it has been a lot of learning new skills using resources from Google Books API, github examples like theo333, google-api, and Github docs. Not to mention registry/npm.com and the plethora of resources sourced on those pages.Figuring out what didn't work was just as valuable as seeing what did. 
I chose this language specifically for the opportunity to learn something new. In any language, I am most versed in writing web applications so I thought I might as well learn as much as possible from this assesment experience.
I am eager to hear feedback and understand where I can improve.
Thank you!
